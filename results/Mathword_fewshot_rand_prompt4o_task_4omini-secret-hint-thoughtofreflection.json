Round to the nearest whole number.",
        "reasoning": "First, we need to calculate the total points scored from the three-pointers. Team A attempted 35 three-pointers and successfully scored 15 of them. Each successful three-pointer is worth 3 points.\n\nTotal points from three-pointers = Number of successful three-pointers \u00d7 Points per three-pointer  \nTotal points from three-pointers = 15 \u00d7 3 = 45 points.\n\nNow, if Team A wants to maintain the same total points but through free throws, they need to score 45 points through free throws. Since each free throw is worth 1 point and they have a free-throw accuracy of 65%, we can calculate the number of free throws they need to attempt.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of free throws they need to attempt. The successful free throws will be \\( 0.65x \\) and they need this to equal 45 points.\n\nSetting up the equation:\n\n0.65x = 45  \nx = 45 \/ 0.65  \nx \u2248 69.23.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, they would need to attempt 69 free throws.",
