        "problem": "A wildlife researcher is studying a pack of wolves in a 450 square kilometer reserve. Initially, the wolf population density was 2.4 wolves per 100 square kilometers. After a successful conservation effort, the population increased by 35%. However, due to limited resources, 15% of the new population had to migrate to neighboring territories. How many wolves currently remain in the reserve? Round to the nearest whole number.",
        "reasoning": "1. Calculate the initial wolf population:\n   - The area of the reserve is 450 square kilometers.\n   - The initial population density is 2.4 wolves per 100 square kilometers.\n   - Initial population = (450 km\u00b2 \/ 100 km\u00b2) * 2.4 wolves = 10.8 wolves.\n\n2. Calculate the new population after a 35% increase:\n   - Increase = 10.8 wolves * 0.35 = 3.78 wolves.\n   - New population = 10.8 wolves + 3.78 wolves = 14.58 wolves.\n\n3. Calculate the number of wolves that migrated:\n   - Migrated wolves = 14.58 wolves * 0.15 = 2.187 wolves.\n\n4. Calculate the remaining population in the reserve:\n   - Remaining wolves = 14.58 wolves - 2.187 wolves = 12.393 wolves.\n\n5. Round to the nearest whole number:\n   - Remaining wolves \u2248 12 wolves.",

What is the total number of male snow leopards across both mountain ranges? Round to the nearest whole number.",
        "reasoning": "In the first mountain range, there are 45 leopards with a male to female ratio of 2:3. This means that for every 5 leopards, 2 are male and 3 are female. \n\nTo find the number of males in the first range:\n- Total leopards = 45\n- Male fraction = 2\/5\n- Number of males = 45 * (2\/5) = 18 males\n\nIn the second mountain range, there are 30% more leopards than the first range:\n- Additional leopards = 45 * 0.30 = 13.5 (rounding to 14 for whole leopards)\n- Total leopards in the second range = 45 + 14 = 59 leopards\n\nThe male to female ratio in the second range is 3:2, meaning for every 5 leopards, 3 are male.\n- Male fraction = 3\/5\n- Number of males in the second range = 59 * (3\/5) = 35.4 (rounding to 35 for whole leopards)\n\nNow, we add the number of male leopards from both ranges:\n- Total males = 18 (first range) + 35 (second range) = 53 males",

The space walk lasts 15 hours, and each tank provides 5 hours of oxygen. \n\nSo, we calculate:\nNumber of tanks needed = Total hours of space walk \/ Hours of oxygen per tank\nNumber of tanks needed = 15 hours \/ 5 hours per tank = 3 tanks.\n\nThus, the astronaut needs 3 oxygen tanks for the space walk.",
