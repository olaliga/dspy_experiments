        "problem": "A wildlife researcher is studying a population of endangered snow leopards across two mountain ranges. In the first range, there are 45 leopards, with a male to female ratio of 2:3. The second range has 30% more leopards than the first range, but with a male to female ratio of 3:2. What is the total number of male snow leopards across both mountain ranges? Round to the nearest whole number.",
        "reasoning": "In the first mountain range, there are 45 leopards with a male to female ratio of 2:3. This means for every 5 leopards, 2 are male and 3 are female. \n\nTo find the number of males in the first range:\n- Total leopards = 45\n- Male fraction = 2\/5\n- Number of males = 45 * (2\/5) = 18\n\nIn the second mountain range, there are 30% more leopards than the first range:\n- Number of leopards in the second range = 45 + (30% of 45) = 45 + 13.5 = 58.5, which we round to 59 leopards.\n\nThe male to female ratio in the second range is 3:2. This means for every 5 leopards, 3 are male and 2 are female.\n- Male fraction = 3\/5\n- Number of males in the second range = 59 * (3\/5) = 35.4, which we round to 35 males.\n\nNow, we add the number of males from both ranges:\n- Total males = 18 (first range) + 35 (second range) = 53.\n\nThus, the total number of male snow leopards across both mountain ranges is 53.",

        "problem": "A basketball team's average points per game dropped from 96 to 84 after their star player was injured. The coach wants to maintain the same total team points by improving the efficiency of the remaining players. If there are 5 active players on the court, and each player currently scores an equal share of points, by what percentage must each remaining player increase their individual scoring to compensate for the star player's absence? Round to the nearest whole number.",
        "reasoning": "The team originally scored an average of 96 points per game with 5 players, which means the total points scored by the team was 96 points. After the star player was injured, the average dropped to 84 points per game. The total points scored with the remaining players is now 84 points. \n\nTo find out how much each remaining player needs to increase their scoring, we first calculate the total points that need to be maintained, which is still 96 points. \n\nCurrently, with 4 players (since one player is injured), they are scoring 84 points. To find out how many points each of the 4 players needs to score to reach 96 points, we divide 96 by 4, which gives us 24 points per player.\n\nCurrently, each of the 4 players is scoring 84 \/ 4 = 21 points. \n\nNow, we need to find the percentage increase required for each player to go from 21 points to 24 points. The increase in points is 24 - 21 = 3 points.\n\nThe percentage increase is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Increase}}{\\text{Original}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{3}{21} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 14.29\\%\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 14%.",

Multiply the amount of cheese per pan by the number of pans:\n   Total cheese = 2.75 pounds\/pan * 5 pans = 13.75 pounds.\n\n3. Now, we need to calculate the cost of 13.75 pounds of cheese at $8 per pound:\n   Total cost = 13.75 pounds * $8\/pound = $110.\n\nThus, the chef will spend $110 on mozzarella cheese.",
