After a successful conservation effort, the herd's size increased by 62.5%. If the new male to female ratio is now 1:2, how many male elephants were added to the herd during this period?",
        "reasoning": "Initially, there are 48 elephants with a male to female ratio of 1:3. This means there is 1 male for every 3 females. \n\nTo find the number of males and females:\n- Total parts = 1 (male) + 3 (females) = 4 parts\n- Number of males = 48 elephants * (1\/4) = 12 males\n- Number of females = 48 elephants * (3\/4) = 36 females\n\nAfter the conservation effort, the herd size increased by 62.5%. \n- New herd size = 48 elephants * (1 + 0.625) = 48 * 1.625 = 78 elephants\n\nNow, with a new male to female ratio of 1:2:\n- Total parts = 1 (male) + 2 (females) = 3 parts\n- Number of males in the new herd = 78 elephants * (1\/3) = 26 males\n- Number of females in the new herd = 78 elephants * (2\/3) = 52 females\n\nTo find out how many male elephants were added:\n- Males added = New males - Initial males = 26 males - 12 males = 14 males\n\nThus, the number of male elephants added to the herd during this period is 14.",

        "reasoning": "To find out how much money the chef will spend on diced carrots, we first need to calculate the total amount of diced carrots needed for 8 batches. Each batch requires 2\u00be cups of diced carrots.\n\n1. Convert 2\u00be cups to an improper fraction:\n   - 2\u00be = 2 + \u00be = 2 + 0.75 = 2.75 cups\n\n2. Calculate the total cups needed for 8 batches:\n   - Total cups = 2.75 cups\/batch \u00d7 8 batches = 22 cups\n\n3. Calculate the total cost:\n   - Each cup costs $1.50, so the total cost = 22 cups \u00d7 $1.50\/cup = $33.00\n\nThus, the chef will spend $33.00 on diced carrots.",
