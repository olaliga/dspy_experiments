        "problem": "An astronaut needs to pack oxygen tanks for a space walk. If each tank contains 5 hours of oxygen, and the space walk will last 15 hours, how many oxygen tanks does the astronaut need?",
        "reasoning": "To determine how many oxygen tanks the astronaut needs, we can divide the total duration of the space walk by the amount of oxygen each tank provides. Each tank provides 5 hours of oxygen, and the space walk will last 15 hours. \n\nSo, we calculate:\nNumber of tanks needed = Total hours of space walk \/ Hours of oxygen per tank\nNumber of tanks needed = 15 hours \/ 5 hours per tank = 3 tanks.\n\nThus, the astronaut needs 3 oxygen tanks for the space walk.",

The band started with 5 guitar picks and then bought 7 more. \n\nSo, the calculation is:\n5 (initial picks) + 7 (bought picks) = 12 (total picks).",
